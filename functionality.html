                <h2>Interplanetary communications</h2>
                <h3>NASA Deep Space Network</h3>
                    <blockquote>“It's the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system in the world.”</blockquote>
                    <p class="right">- NASA</p>
                    <p>The Deep Space Network consists of enormous radio antennas located equidistantly around the world (in California - USA, Madrid - Spain, and Canberra - Australia). This is done so that spacecraft can maintain communications with Earth regardless of at what point in it's rotation our planet is.<br>
                        The DSN support interplanetary and orbital missions, as well as radio and astronomy observations.<br>
                        NASA's Mars rovers such as Curiosity communicate with Earth using the DSN. Before the rover can send data to Earth, it has to relay it through Mars Odyssey or Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

                <h3>Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System</h3>
                    <p>The TDRSS is a network connecting communications satellites and ground stations controlled by NASA. Each communications satellite is called, unsurprisingly, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS). The TDRSS is used for communicating with low-earth orbiting spacecraft, unlike the Deep Space Network.<br>
                        The network consists of 3 segments: the ground segment, the space segment, and the user segment. The ground segment is made up of 3 stations located in New Mexico. The ground segment controls and commands the other nodes on the network. The space segment has orbital 6 satellites, 3 of which are used as primary satellites. In the user segment, space programs relay their observations to Earth through the space segment satellites.<br>
                        Hubble Space Telescope, LANDSAT, and the International Space Station use the TDRSS for communications.</p>

                <h3>Radio astronomy</h3>
                    <p>Radio astronomy uses giant radio antennas: some of them can look similar to satellite dishes, while others look like tent frames. The antennas pick up radio signals generated by natural celestial objects. <br>
                    The size and shape of the antenna depend on the frequencies they are designed to detect.
                    Large dish-like antennas are used for gathering weak signals from deep space. The dish shape allows signals to reflect into to detector in the centre above the dish. The signals are processed using a computer, and combined to form a high-resolution image.</p>
