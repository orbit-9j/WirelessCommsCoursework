                    <h2>About this technology</h2>
                    <p>Wireless communication is the electromagnetic transfer of information between devices. Radio waves are the most commonly used range of EM radiation for this purpose. </p>
                    <p>Wireless communication is called unguided medium because it does not require a physical medium for the signal to propagate. On the other hand, wired communication is called guided medium because it requires some sort of cable.</p>
                    <p>Benefits of wireless communication over wired communications include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mobility: you can stay connected to the wireless network in any part of the room as long as you are within range of the signal</li>
                        <li>Cost: there is no need to buy and install cables for a wireless network</li>
                        <li>Ease of installation: the effort of laying cables is absent in wireless networks</li>
                        <li>Reliability: no chance of cables becoming damaged since no cables are used</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Disadvantages of wireless communication include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interference: if two technologies (like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) operate on the same frequency, they can interfere with each other if used at the same time</li>
                        <li>Security: it is easier to intercept wireless signals than wired signals</li>
                    </ul>
