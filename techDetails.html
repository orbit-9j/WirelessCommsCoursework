                    <p>Information can be transferred wirelessly both over short distances (a few meters, for example a laptop connecting to a phone via Bluetooth) and large distances (millions of kilometers, for example a control centre computer on Earth connecting to a Mars rover)</p>
                    <h2>Methods of transmission</h2>
                    <p>There is a variety of ways in which information can be transferred wirelessly:</p>
                    <h3>Radio</h3>
                        <p>Radio waves are a range of electromagnetic radiation between 20 kHz and 1,000 GHz. A transmitter generates radio waves, and the antenna to which it is connected radiates those waves to another antenna, which is connected to a receiver. <br>
                        Radio waves are the result of moving electric charges in the transmitter. Applying an alternating current of different frequencies by the transmitter results in different radio frequencies being emitted by the antenna.<br>
                        Each transmitter uses a certain radio frequency on a radio spectrum to avoid signals from many transmitters interfering with each other. Receivers use tuned circuits to pick out the desired radio signal from a variety of signals they receive.</p>

                    <h3>Free-space optical</h3>
                        <p>“Free space” can refer to both air and outer space. Free-space optical communication does not use solid mediums for visible light to propagate in (so by that logic, fibre-optic cables are not free-space optical communication despite also using light).<br>
                            This method of wireless communication is limited in terrestrial applications due to fog and other atmospheric conditions that reduce visibility. However, laser communication in space is currently being tested as a way for satellite communication.</p>
